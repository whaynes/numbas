Problem loading .exam files in safari	
	"An error occurred when trying to load the resource."
	"The resource was loaded insecurely"
	
	Tried this:  Didn't seem to work
		For free MAMP
		Use a text editor to open the file. You may need administrator privileges to save changes.
		Add the CORS header directive inside the <Directory /> block. If the block doesn't exist, you may need to add it. The final block should look like this:
		<Directory />
		    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks AllowOverride All
 		    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
		</Directory>
		Restart your MAMP servers to apply the changes.
